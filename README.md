# Sentiment-Analysis-of-COVID-19-Vaccination-on-Twitter

## Overview
This project analyzes public sentiment on Twitter regarding COVID-19 vaccination using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The data contains over 16,000 tweets classified into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.

The analysis uses feature extraction methods such as Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, and applies a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. The visual outputs, including loss, accuracy graphs, and word clouds, are included below.

## Steps for Power BI Project
1. **Gather Data**: Collect necessary data from various sources.
2. **Power Query â€“ Data ETL**: Clean and transform the data using Power Query Editor.
3. **Create a Date Table**: Essential for DAX time intelligence functions.
4. **Create Data Model**: In Power BI Desktop, representing relationships between tables.
5. **Develop Reports**: Use Power BI Desktop to create reports with visualizations.
    - Create report background in PowerPoint.
    - Implement slicers for Date, City, Product, and Channel.
    - Develop DAX measures.
    - Create visuals for sales, profit, and more.

### DAX Calculations Examples
```dax
Sales = SUM(Sales_Data[Sales])
Sales PY = CALCULATE([Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(DateTable[Date]))
Sales vs PY = [Sales] - [Sales PY]
Sales vs py % = DIVIDE([Sales vs PY],[Sales],0)
Products Sold = SUM(Sales_Data[Order Quantity])
Profit = SUM(Sales_Data[Profit])
